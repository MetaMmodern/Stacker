# Stacker

Stacker is a declarative programming language, made for counting mathematical expressions.

Stacker is done within Kyiv Polytechnic Institute course of Declarative Programming.

## Technologies

Stacker is written in JavaScript ES6 and runs on Node.js. No aditional packages are neccessary to run the code. All you need is Node.js.

## Polish Notation

Stacker uses **reversed** simple polish notation syntax without parenthesis, seperated with linebreaks(`\n`). You can find out more about polish notation from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation) and [here](https://planetmath.org/moreexamplesofpolishnotation).

## How to run

1. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (if you don't have it).
2. Clone this repo to your machine.
3. Open any shell in projects root directory.
4. Run `npm install` (optional).
5. Run `node index.js [YOUR_FILE]` or `npm start [YOUR_FILE]`.

You can also run local tests from `./tests` folder.
